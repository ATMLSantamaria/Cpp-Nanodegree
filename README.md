# C++ Nanodegree
Projects associated with Udacity's C++ Nanodegree.

This repository contains material related to Udacity's C++ Nanodegree program. Each project aims to use modern C++(>C++11) for developing solutions for
some "real world" challenges.

- [Route Planning](https://github.com/ATMLSantamaria/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/main/CppND-Route-Planning-Project): Implement the A* search algorithm to find a path between two nodes on a map.
- [System Monitor](https://github.com/ATMLSantamaria/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/main/CppND-System-Monitor): Build a simple version of a system monitor for Linux that profiles both CPU and memory usage.
- [Memory Management Chatbot](https://github.com/ATMLSantamaria/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/main/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot2): Practice memory management techniques, with a focus on smart pointers, via a simple chatbot application.
- [Concurrent Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/ATMLSantamaria/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/main/Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation): Program a traffic simulator that models intersections, vehicles, and traffic lights as independent threads. Coordinate data access via a message queue to exchange information among threads.
- [Classic Snake Game](https://github.com/ATMLSantamaria/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/main/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game2): Functionalities of Classical Snake Game plus the option of run the Snake by a simple AI
